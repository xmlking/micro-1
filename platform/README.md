# Micro Platform

The micro platform is a serverless platform for microservices development

## Overview

**M3O** is a serverless platform for microservices development based on the open source Micro Runtime. 
This directory serves as the location for all related configuration for running the platform. Micro, the company, 
is providing a hosted offering but anyone should be free to pickup and run this configuration for themselves anywhere.

You should be able to pick up and use the configuration here on kubernetes for a self-hosted serverless platform.

## Getting Started

For self hosting look at the [kubernetes](https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/platform/kubernetes) repo. To learn more about the M3O serverless platform see the [docs](https://micro.mu/docs/platform.html).
